## Executive Summary

Crypto Sudoku represents the next evolution in blockchain gaming by transforming the classic puzzle game Sudoku into a competitive, skill-based play-to-earn ecosystem. By combining the timeless appeal of Sudoku with blockchain technology, we've created a platform where players can showcase their puzzle-solving skills, compete in seasonal leaderboards, and earn rewards—all secured by advanced cryptographic verification.

## The Problem

The current blockchain gaming landscape is saturated with:
- Games that rely heavily on chance rather than skill
- High entry barriers requiring significant initial investment
- Complex gameplay mechanics that deter mainstream adoption
- Limited engagement beyond financial speculation

## Our Solution

Crypto Sudoku introduces a skill-based alternative to the play-to-earn space with:

- **Familiar, Accessible Gameplay**: Leveraging the universally recognized rules of Sudoku
- **Genuine Skill-Based Competition**: Success depends on puzzle-solving ability, not chance or spending power
- **Low Entry Barrier**: A single NFT grants lifetime access to the game
- **Fair, Transparent Competition**: Cryptographically verified scores ensure leaderboard integrity
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Initially deployed on Mint Sepolia and Monad Testnet, with plans for expansion

## Key Features
